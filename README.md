# Shortest-Route
An application that finds the most efficient route between given coordinates


Traveling salesman and genetic algorithm were used to solve the problem. Genetic algorithm was used to increase the speed of the result. There are two endpoints where we can reach the shortest route and its alternatives. The first is the Json object that can be accessed with a get request from (http://localhost:4000). The second is the screen showing the visualized data. You can get this via get request (http://localhost:4000/map).
